# Basic requirements

Diva nodes can run on both physical nodes and cloud services.

Your staking node needs:

- sufficiently powerful hardware
- a reliable internet connection
- at least 1.5TB of internet bandwidth per month

The hardware you will need depends on how you are running Diva. Diva itself is not very computationally intensive, but it requires that you are running a full node. This means that you will need to have enough storage space to store the entire blockchain, and enough bandwidth to keep up with the network.

To that end, the hardware you will need depends on whether you are already running an Ethereum consensus client and execution client. If you are, then running Diva will take very little additional resources. If you are not running one yet, you will need to spec your node device accordingly.

**These docs assume you need to spec your device to run both Diva and the requisite Ethereum clients.**
