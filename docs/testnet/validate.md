Congratulations on [installing your Diva node](../testnet/install/download)!

In Diva, all ETH deposits from Stakers are used to create Ethereum validators in increments of 32 ETH.

Once a validator is created, the Diva Smart Contract creates multiple keyshares which are delivered to Diva nodes like you.

Diva nodes need to post enough (div)ETH collateral to the Diva smart contract to become eligible to receive keyshares.

ðŸ‘‰ [Learn more about Diva Operators](https://docs.staking.foundation/operators) in the Diva general docs.

## How to receive validator keys

:::info
**In the current version, no ETH collateral is needed**. Keyshares are distributed randomly to all Diva nodes which are online.
:::

If you'd like to increase the chances of receiving a keyshare, you can [stake more ETH in the testnet](https://stake.diva.community/).

In future testnet releases, you will be required to post ETH collateral to receive keyshares, as described in the [Diva Operators general docs](https://docs.staking.foundation/operators).

## Next steps

During the Diva testnet, it's important that you always keep your node up to date with the latest version. See the [Update your node](update/update-diva-auto) section.

Failing to update might mean you stop receiving keyshares and you will degrade the overall network performance (which relies on your DVT).

The Diva testnet is still adding features and evolving, enjoy the ride!
